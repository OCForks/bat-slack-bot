# bat-slack-bot
Based on Aragon's [slack-bot](https://github.com/aragon/slack-bot).

## Preparation
First,
go to https://.../apps/A0F7YS25R-bots which is where the "Bots" configuration lives.
Click on "Add Configuration" and enter `@bat-bot` for the username.
You will need the use value for the "API Token" for the configuration step,
so copy-paste this.
Then,
fill-in however much information you want and click "Save Integration".




## Configuration
Edit the file `config/config.production.js` when used in production,
otherwise:

        cp config/config.development.js.tpl config/config.development.js

and then edit `config/config.development.js`.

Once you have the `bat-slack-bot` running,
go the monitoring channel configured, and enter:

        @bat-bot

to invite `@bat-bot` to the channel.
The `@slackbot` will respond with:

        You mentioned @bat-bot, but theyâ€™re not in this channel. Would you like to
        - invite them to join
        - or have Slackbot send them a link to your message?
        - Or, do nothing.

Please click on the first link and then restart the `bat-slack-bot` and in the monitoring channel,
the `@bat-bot` will reply with:

_reporting for duty_

## Operation
Take a look at `worker.js` and you'll see the many insightful remarks that the `bat-slack-bot` has to opine with.


Enjoy!
